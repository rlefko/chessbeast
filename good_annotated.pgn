{I'm coming off a loss, but one where I played well. I would like for this
tournament to not pull my rating down if I can help it. Let's deliver a strong
performance} 1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann $1} 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 {This is called the
Breyer} 3... g6 {It's definitely playable but its themes deviate from the
Caro-Kann} 4. g3 {It's effectively playing the King's Indian Attack against the
Caro-Kann} 4... Bg7 {If the Caro-Kann Player fails to adapt, they will just fall
behind. They need to take space and actually work the Kingside} 5. Rb1 {after
this move, there are no master games in this position} (5. Bg2 {this is
typically what's played at the master level} 5... e5 6. Ngf3 Ne7 7. O-O O-O 8.

imbalance, this is a draw}) 10... b6 11. d4 exd4 12. Nxd4 Bb7 13. exd5 Nxd5 14.
Nc4 Nc5 15. Ne5 Bxe5 16. Rxe5 $14 {This position was reached in 2 of Javokhir
Sindarov's games in 2024, but is actually slightly better for white. That makes
sense since Sindarov was white in both games.}) 5... e5 {and after this move,
there are no games left in the lichess database in this position. However,
nobody found a move as strong as e5} (5... c5 {this move is also quite strong}
6. Bg2 Nf6 7. e5 Ng4 8. b4 Nxe5 9. bxc5 Ned7 10. Ne2 Nxc5 {in this line, black
actually wins a pawn early, but there is nuance} 11. d4 Na4 12. c4 Nb6 13. c5

actually plays into a crazy looking drawn position so I'd like to investigate}

will certainly become snipers} 6. Nxe4 Nf6 7. Nxf6+ Bxf6 8. a3 Be6 9. Nf3 Ba2

you}) 6. Bg2 {a perfectly thematic move} 6... Ne7 {was a toss up, but the
possibility of the f5 break later on really made me choose this more
passive-looking move} (6... Nf6 {engine argues this is very slightly better but
that isn't really important} 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. O-O Re8 9. Re1 d4 10. Nc4 Bg4 11. h3

structure} 7... Bg4 {maybe a bit ambitious} 8. O-O {the cherry on top} 8... O-O
{in kind} 9. Qe1 {white breaks the pin and creates the threat of taking on d4 to
create a hanging pawn on e4} 9... Re8 {addressing the threat} (9... Qc7 {a more
active move which achieves the same thing}) 10. h3 Bxf3 $6 {exchanging.
Surprisingly, the wrong idea} (10... Be6 {and the idea is pretty clear: avoiding
the exchange makes black's coordination much more difficult. To trade is to
untangle the white pieces.} 11. b4 {this is the move white must find in this
case} (11. Nb3 $6 dxe4 12. dxe4 Bc4) 11... Nc8 12. Nb3 dxe4 13. Ng5 Bxb3 14. Rxb3

strongest, but positionally, this prevents any piece from coming to g5} 12. Be3

likes this move by white} 12... d4 {kicking the bishop, though this also seals
away black's dark-squared bishop} (12... a5 {this is an option now, wow}) 13.

participate} 14. Qc1 {making a clear threat} 14... Kh7 {addressing that threat}

advance for now} 23... b3 {a tricky pawn sacrifice. The idea here is to open up
to position and allow for black to start picking off pawns} 24. c4 {this move is
logical, as it's hard to assess the viability of taking the pawn} (24. cxb3 {as
it turns out, it is best to accept the sacrifice} 24... Rab8 25. Qd1 Qe6 26.

interesting move} 25. Bxc3 $6 (25. bxc3 {stronger to take with the pawn, as there

86 percent accuracy, I delivered a deadly 91.4 percent accuracy. However, I did
allow for counterplay in the f-file, and my position was quite passive. Had that
not occurred, it could have been an even stronger performance. Regardless, it
was a pleasure to analyze with my opponent. He had a lot of cool stories, and I
think we're not too dissimilar in personality and interests, so we talked for
over an hour. On to the next one.} 0-1
