{Opening: The game began with the Caro-Kann Defense, a solid and popular choice for Black aiming to control the center with pawns rather than pieces.

Shreyo Banerjee managed to capitalize on Ryan Lefkowitz's inaccuracies, particularly after the blunder on move 20, which allowed White to consolidate a material advantage. Despite a blunder by White, the game swung decisively in White's favor after Black failed to capitalize on the opportunity, leading to a winning position for White.

Key moments:
- Move 12: Black played 12... h6, an inaccuracy that weakened the kingside and lost 96 centipawns.
- Move 14: Black's 14... Be6 was a mistake that allowed White to seize the initiative, losing 177 centipawns.
- Move 20: White blundered with 20. Rd3, but Black's immediate blunder with 20... Bc4 failed to exploit it, keeping White ahead.

Lessons:
- Focus on controlling the center and avoid unnecessary pawn moves that weaken your position.
- When your opponent makes a mistake, look for ways to take advantage rather than responding passively.
- Blunders can happen to both sides; stay alert for opportunities to recover when your opponent falters.}
