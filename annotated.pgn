{Opening: The game opened with the Caro-Kann Defense, a solid choice for Black aiming for a strong pawn structure and strategic play.

Both players navigated the opening reasonably well, but Black's inaccuracies began to accumulate. White capitalized on Black's mistakes in the middlegame, especially after a critical exchange of blunders on move 20. White maintained the advantage and skillfully converted it into a win.

Key moments:
- Move 12: Black played 12... h6, a small inaccuracy that allowed White to gain a slight edge.
- Move 20: White's blunder with 20. Rd3 was immediately countered by Black's blunder 20... Bc4, shifting the advantage back to White.
- Move 18: Black's 18... Bxd5 was a mistake that weakened their position, allowing White to seize control.

Lessons:
- Avoid unnecessary pawn moves like 12... h6 that don't contribute to your plan and can weaken your position.
- When your opponent makes a mistake, focus on maintaining the advantage by playing accurately rather than rushing your moves.
- Be cautious with exchanges; ensure they don't result in a worse position for you, as seen with 18... Bxd5.}
